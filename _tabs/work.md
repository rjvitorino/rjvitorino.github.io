## Professional Experience

My track record speaks for itself; I have secured over 20 grants to fund projects that have brought new technologies to life. My proficiency in Python and Django, coupled with my understanding of cloud computing, Internet of Things, and Geographic Information Systems, has allowed me to cater to diverse customer needs. The systems developed are robust and dependable, serving as the backbone of the daily operations of more than 12 cities.

I have significantly grown [Ubiwhere](https://ubiwhere.com/)'s impact on the smart city market. I have spearheaded initiatives that promote the development of connected city infrastructure, leading to the growth of strategic partnerships that have amplified our ideas and solutions, reaching a wider audience.</p>

Working with groups like [AIOTI](https://aioti.eu/), [BDVA](https://www.bdva.eu/), [ETSI](https://www.etsi.org/), and [FIWARE](https://www.fiware.org/), I have pushed for technology that improves our quality of life, since I believe in tech that serves a purpose and enhances urban living.
