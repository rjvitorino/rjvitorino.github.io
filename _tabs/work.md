## Professional Experience

My track record speaks for itself; I have secured over 20 grants to fund projects that have brought new technologies to life. My proficiency in Python and Django, coupled with my understanding of cloud computing, the Internet of Things, and Geographic Information Systems, has allowed me to cater to diverse customer needs. The systems I have developed are robust and dependable, serving as the backbone of the daily operations of more than 12 cities.

I am currently working as a Product Manager at [Untile](https://untile.pt/), where I lead the development of innovative software solutions. Previously, I significantly grew [Ubiwhere](https://ubiwhere.com/)'s impact on the smart city market by spearheading initiatives that promote connected city infrastructure and strategic partnerships, amplifying ideas and solutions to a wider audience.

Working with groups like [AIOTI](https://aioti.eu/), [BDVA](https://www.bdva.eu/), [ETSI](https://www.etsi.org/), and [FIWARE](https://www.fiware.org/), I have pushed for technology that improves our quality of life, since I believe in tech that serves a purpose and enhances urban living.
